20010206_1830_1900_ABC_WNT 1 peter_jennings 220.714000 244.076000 <o,male,ABC_WNT> Now we go to the other big story of the day and it is almost invariably the economy There was bad news for what was a dot com success story not long ago E.  toys says it will run out of cash in six weeks And Cisco Systems the world's number one maker of computer networking equipment is reporting slipping sales Betsy Stark is with us today  It  is the kind of news that gets the President's attention is it not 
20010206_1830_1900_ABC_WNT 1 betsy_stark 244.076000 264.433000 <o,female,ABC_WNT>  That  is right Peter because he seems to like to use every new piece of bad news to promote his big tax cut The important thing to know however is that not all the news is bad The President's message today at a Washington area toy store is that businesses and consumers need a tax cut right away He has said it repeatedly 
20010206_1830_1900_ABC_WNT 1 george_w_bush 264.433000 270.343000 <o,male,ABC_WNT> The economy is slowing down and we need to act and act as quickly as we possibly can

20010206_1830_1900_ABC_WNT 1 betsy_stark 286.068000 309.020000 <o,female,ABC_WNT> Around the country there is growing confusion about the state of the economy and if  it  is bad what to do about it There was news today that layoffs piled up at a record pace in January but a report last week showing the economy continues to create thousands of new jobs The current president of the National Association of Business Economists says manufacturing is in recession 
20010206_1830_1900_ABC_WNT 1 spkr_5 309.020000 316.404000 <o,male,ABC_WNT> And we are starting to see the first signs I believe that other parts of the economy are about to join them as well 
20010206_1830_1900_ABC_WNT 1 betsy_stark 316.404000 321.352000 <o,female,ABC_WNT> The past president of the association says the economy is poised to pick up again 
20010206_1830_1900_ABC_WNT 1 spkr_6 321.352000 328.778000 <o,female,ABC_WNT>  There  is a very high probability that this economy twelve months from now will be in the position of the Fed worrying about it overheating again 
20010206_1830_1900_ABC_WNT 1 betsy_stark 328.778000 358.421000 <o,female,ABC_WNT> Ultimately the opinion that matters most is consumers Their spending drives the economy And recent surveys show a sharp drop in their confidence about the future But ask consumers how they feel right now and  it  is a different story According to an A.  B.  C.  Money poll released today sixty-five percent give their personal finances a positive rating Which means for all the bad news about layoffs and business failures most consumers still feel good about their own security Peter

20010206_1830_1900_ABC_WNT 1 jackie_judd 387.780000 415.039000 <o,female,ABC_WNT> In the final hours of his administration President Clinton wiped the record clean for businessman Glen Braswell the founder of a controversial herbal remedies empire who in nineteen eighty-three was convicted of mail fraud perjury and tax evasion But there was more Braswell is under investigation today by federal prosecutors for money laundering and tax evasion Stephen Barrett investigates health care scams 
20010206_1830_1900_ABC_WNT 1 stephen_barrett 415.039000 423.516000 <o,male,ABC_WNT> I find it (w-) find it hard to believe that the people who pardoned him knew about all of his activities Of course if they did that would make it much more serious 
20010206_1830_1900_ABC_WNT 1 jackie_judd 423.516000 456.163000 <o,female,ABC_WNT> Mr Clinton said through a spokesman today he did not know about this latest investigation That could be because the White House failed to give the Justice Department enough time about seventy-two hours at the most or documentation to review the pardon request Why did Braswell's request rise to the top of the pile That is unclear He has no apparent ties to the former president or to the Democratic party The only known connection seems to be that his attorney Kendall Coffey represented vice-president Gore in the Florida recount 
20010206_1830_1900_ABC_WNT 1 spkr_7 456.163000 466.761000 <o,female,ABC_WNT> I  have  not seen a justification for some of the pardons that seem to be irregular and if they be forthcoming but in the absence of a justification you have to wonder 
20010206_1830_1900_ABC_WNT 1 jackie_judd 466.761000 490.501000 <o,female,ABC_WNT> A spokesman for Mr Clinton said Braswell was viewed as a businessman seeking to clear his slate so he could go on with his business career The pardon does not affect the ongoing investigation so Braswell's business career may still be in jeopardy and Mr Clinton is still dealing with the fallout from his final days in office Jackie Judd A.

S.  and British warplanes targeted radar and command centers near Baghdad in response to what was reportedly mounting Iraqi threats against air patrols President Bush says the attacks were a routine mission to enforce a no fly zone over southern Iraq But key United Nations Security Council members are criticizing the U.

20010217_1000_1030_VOA_ENG 1 dale_gavlak 397.545000 556.330000 <o,female,VOA_ENG> Iraq's state run television broadcast President Saddam Hussein's emergency session with the country's revolutionary command council following Friday's air raids The Iraqi leader vowed not to succumb to what he called criminal American aggression In his comments President Saddam did not mention Britain saying the strikes were part of a wider American and Zionist strategy that cannot force Iraq to give up its rights He called the bombing a prelude to holy war and urged Arabs everywhere to unite against the aggression Iraq's media Saturday heaped fiery condemnation on the United States The official Qadissiya newspaper said in a front page editorial that the Americans' and Britain's new savage crime would not pass unpunished and without decisive retaliation The newspaper called President George W.  Bush the son of a viper and promised to teach him a lesson that he will not forget President Bush's father George Bush led the nineteen ninety-one Gulf War coalition against Iraq that ended its six-month occupation of Kuwait The government newspaper Al Jumhuriya Saturday described the attack as a cowardly act and another failing action by the tyrant rulers of the criminal American administration It said the strikes were a breach of international law and the United Nations Security Charter Iraqi television showed images of an eighteen-year old woman and a man believed to be in his thirties who it said died in the attack It also broadcast pictures from Iraqi hospitals of children with bandaged legs and feet receiving treatment for their wounds Iraqi Health Minister Omed Madhat Mubarak said women children and the elderly were among those injured He added that some of them were in critical condition The Pentagon says the raids targeted radar and command centers that control Iraqi air defenses farther south in the Western-patrolled no-fly zone President Bush described the attacks as routine and necessary to enforce a no-fly zone over southern Iraq He warned that the U.  S.  will take what he called appropriate action if President Saddam develops weapons of mass destruction The raid is believed to have been the single biggest air strike against Iraq since the nineteen ninety-eight Operation Desert Fox bombing campaign that followed Baghdad's refusal to allow United Nations arms inspectors into selected areas Iraqi citizens said the missiles hit a rural agricultural region though Washington maintains that Baghdad places military installations in civilian areas a charge that the Iraqi leadership denies Dale Gavlak for V.

20010217_1000_1030_VOA_ENG 1 philip_alexio 556.330000 571.899000 <o,male,VOA_ENG> Mr Bush's saying the mission was routine has some backing among defense analysts here in the United States Michael O'Hanlon is with the Brookings Institution and told N.  B.  C.'s Soledad O'Brien there appears to be no particular message behind the attack 
20010217_1000_1030_VOA_ENG 1 michael_o_hanlon 571.899000 599.867000 <o,male,VOA_ENG> I think it was trying to continue the same policy of making sure we can carry out these no fly zone operations without much risk to our pilots Apparently Iraq had developed some new tactics perhaps using two radars in combination with each other so we  could  not figure out (w-) (%hesitation) which one to target or get a track on on (%hesitation) one radar long enough to shoot it and destroy it I think those are the sorts of things that led to this attack and in that sense  it  is really just a tactical modification of the same basic policy that  we  have had for a long time 
20010217_1000_1030_VOA_ENG 1 soledad_o_brien 599.867000 603.166000 <o,female,VOA_ENG> Modification of the policy no actual change in policy 
20010217_1000_1030_VOA_ENG 1 michael_o_hanlon 603.166000 631.755000 <o,male,VOA_ENG> Modification just in the sense of what tactics we will use to keep carrying it out safely but yes no change in the policy There may later on be a change I think President Bush is having a review right now of his basic Iraq policy  They  have got to figure out what to do about getting weapons inspectors back in whether to even try seriously to do that whether to help the Iraqi resistance perhaps even militarily inside Iraq These big basic questions have not yet been answered So for the time being  they  are just continuing Clinton policy 
20010217_1000_1030_VOA_ENG 1 soledad_o_brien 631.755000 638.883000 <o,female,VOA_ENG> (t-) The strikes took place outside of the no-fly zone In and of itself is that significant 
20010217_1000_1030_VOA_ENG 1 michael_o_hanlon 638.883000 673.520000 <o,male,VOA_ENG> Well it was clearly enough to cause consultation with Mr Bush and to create of course this media coverage which I think frankly surprised Mr Bush a little bit I  do  not believe he expected the media coverage to essentially dominate yesterday's news when he went to Mexico But in another sense I would say no  it  is not a big deal (%hesitation) The basic idea is we cannot give Iraq a sanctuary from which to shoot at our planes in the no fly zone region So if  they  are using radars around Baghdad to target our planes that are south of Baghdad then we have to be able to go after those radars even if they are in the you know (th-) the central part of Iraq that we have not been trying to control 
20010217_1000_1030_VOA_ENG 1 soledad_o_brien 673.520000 682.513000 <o,female,VOA_ENG> In recent weeks Bush officials have spoken a lot about symbolism when it comes to foreign policy Do you think there is some important component of this that is symbolic 
20010217_1000_1030_VOA_ENG 1 michael_o_hanlon 682.513000 702.950000 <o,male,VOA_ENG> I doubt it you know because I (th-) I doubt they want to just be seen as carrying out Bill Clinton's policy as the main way in which they establish themselves There was a lot of criticism of Bill Clinton as commander in chief and this really is not much more than the sort of thing he was doing for eight years So I  do  not think this is the sort of thing they would see as this symbolic definition of the Bush presidency and foreign policy

Attorney's office in New York is probing whether political contributions from Marc Rich's ex-wife Denise played a role in Mr Clinton's last-minute pardon Since nineteen ninety-two Denise Rich has contributed more than a million dollars to the Democratic party four hundred fifty thousand dollars to the Clinton Presidential Library Fund and more than a hundred thousand dollars to Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign Marc Rich fled the United States for Switzerland in nineteen eighty-three He was wanted by the Justice Department on charges of evading more than forty-eight million dollars in taxes and for allegedly arranging illegal oil deals with Iran The lead prosecutor in the Rich case Sandy Weinberg says the Clinton White House made little effort to find out the facts of the case before issuing the pardon on January twentieth Mr Weinberg spoke on C.

I.  has been arrested and charged with spying for the Russians The agent Robert Phillip Hanssen was detained Sunday at his home outside Washington after allegedly dropping off a document for his Russian handler Today Justice Department officials said that Hanssen has been passing secrets to Moscow since the mid nineteen eighties They also allege that he betrayed three Soviet officials who spied for the United States Buck Revell is a former assistant director of operations at the F.  B.  I.  Mr Revell first thank you for taking the time to speak to us and we want to listen first to the F.  B.  I.  director Louis Freeh at this afternoon's news conference in Washington 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 louis_freeh 412.595000 447.469000 <o,male,PRI_TWD> It is alleged that Hanssen provided to the former Soviet Union and subsequently to Russia substantial volumes of highly classified information that he acquired during the course of his job responsibilities in counterintelligence In return he received large sums of money and other remuneration including diamonds The complaint alleges that he received over six hundred thousand dollars in cash The full extent of the damage done is yet unknown because no accurate damage assessment could be done during the course of the covert investigation without jeopardizing it We believe however that it was exceptionally grave 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 lisa_mullins 447.469000 456.765000 <o,female,PRI_TWD> So Buck Revell from your knowledge of the F.  B.  I.  and as you hear director Freeh speaking there what do you deduce from that sort of language when he says exceptionally grave How damaging do you think this case has been 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 buck_revell 456.765000 485.357000 <o,male,PRI_TWD> Well from the outset it appears to be very damaging because (%hesitation) of one he had such a long Hanssen had such a long term of assignment in counterintelligence and was operating in areas where extremely sensitive information is dealt with (%hesitation) and of course he was also seconded to the State Department to assist them in creating (%hesitation) their own counter intelligence capability (%hesitation) and and that of course (%hesitation) makes a very egregious circumstance 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 lisa_mullins 485.357000 493.036000 <o,female,PRI_TWD> And when you talk about intelligence capabilities Mr Hanssen was a counterintelligence expert What kind of secrets could he have passed on to the Russians 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 buck_revell 493.036000 520.821000 <o,male,PRI_TWD> Well (i-) in counterintelligence (%hesitation) you are really charged with knowing (w-) what the activities are of your (%hesitation) opposition so he could have passed on (%hesitation) F.  B.  I.  investigations into Russian agents operating in the United States into clandestine (%hesitation) methods and operations of both F.  B.  I.  and U.  S.  (%hesitation) intelligence services (%hesitation) as well as (%hesitation) any sort of (%hesitation) recruitment in place that we might have (t-) the Bureau might have obtained to work against the Russians 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 lisa_mullins 520.821000 525.420000 <o,female,PRI_TWD> And can you mention specific areas in terms of working against the Russians I mean what are we talking about here 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 buck_revell 525.420000 548.025000 <o,male,PRI_TWD> Well in dealing (%hesitation) with the Russians of course the F.  B.  I.'s concern is to counter the intelligence activities the (%hesitation) covert intelligence operations of (%hesitation) the Russians in the United States The U.  S.  intelligence community on the other hand (%hesitation) is concerned with developing information within Russia as to its activities that might be detrimental or (its-) could be of concern to the United States 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 lisa_mullins 548.025000 552.920000 <o,female,PRI_TWD> So is there a chance that if indeed he is guilty that he has put the lives of Americans in danger 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 buck_revell 552.920000 584.527000 <o,male,PRI_TWD> (%hesitation) He (m-) may well have put the lives of (m-) American double agents other words Russians working for (%hesitation) the U.  S.  government for the C.  I.  A.  or (f-) one of the other intelligence services at risk and in particular if he (%hesitation) was (%hesitation) doing anything with the information (%hesitation) (tha-) (w-) that (%hesitation) Ames was providing to the Russians (%hesitation) we do know that (%hesitation) (%hesitation) at least ten (%hesitation) Russian double agents those working for the United States were executed by the Soviets back in the Soviet era based on Ames' information 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 lisa_mullins 584.527000 600.210000 <o,female,PRI_TWD> It has been said that Mr Hanssen was arrested after he made a dead drop as they call it of classified documents in a Virginia park which all sounds very Cold War James Bondesque Have things not changed in the intelligence world since the end of the Cold War I mean why are we still spying on each other 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 buck_revell 600.210000 623.036000 <o,male,PRI_TWD> Well  we  are still spying on each other because (%hesitation) things happen (%hesitation) (%hesitation) (i-) (i-) in governments that (%hesitation) (%hesitation) other governments (d-) think they need to know about Now sometimes it has shifted from (%hesitation) (%hesitation) political and military intelligence to high technology (n-) intellectual property and (%hesitation) economic issues (%hesitation) as well as of course the traditional (%hesitation) (%hesitation) political military circumstance 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 lisa_mullins 623.036000 632.038000 <o,female,PRI_TWD> (%hesitation) (f-) Final question There were congratulations understandably all around today at the press conference but (o-) (o-) one question we have is why did it take so long for anyone to realize what was going on 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 buck_revell 632.038000 669.244000 <o,male,PRI_TWD> Well (%hesitation) a counterintelligence officer (%hesitation) is probably the most difficult to catch because his job is to catch others doing the same thing so he is aware of the trade craft He knows the methods of operation of the Bureau and the Agency the C.  I.  A.  as well as of course the Russians themselves so a person in counter intelligence as (%hesitation) (%hesitation) Aldridge Ames was is really (i-) in a in a key position to understand how to best go about avoiding detection and they are trained in detecting this type of activity so when they choose to betray their country they are well versed in how to go about that without (%hesitation) being detected 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 lisa_mullins 669.244000 673.855000 <o,female,PRI_TWD> Former assistant director of operations for the F.  B.  I.  Buck Revell thank you very much

20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 lisa_mullins 675.210000 697.017000 <o,female,PRI_TWD> Allegations of spying for the Russian government  are  not the only contemporary echo of the Cold War Russia and the West are also tussling over other familiar issues including nuclear weapons and the actions of NATO These topics headed the agenda in Moscow today when visiting NATO Secretary General George Robertson met with Russia's president Vladimir Putin The World's Nened Sebek has more from the Russian capital 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 nened_sebek 697.017000 716.155000 <o,male,PRI_TWD> The visit by Robertson was meant to mark a new better phase in NATO's relationship with Moscow But coming straight after the Anglo American bombing of Iraq condemned by the Kremlin it  did  not look all that promising today Robertson's first meeting this morning with Russia's defense minister Igor Sergeyev immediately snagged on Russia's main problem with NATO

20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 nened_sebek 718.025000 760.588000 <o,male,PRI_TWD> Defense minister Sergeyev explains that of course the most painful issue for Russia is the eastward expansion of NATO After taking in Poland Hungary and the Czech Republic two years ago NATO now has a waiting list of nine more Central and Eastern European countries The most difficult ones for Russia to swallow are the three Baltic republics Estonia Latvia and Lithuania all of them until a decade ago a part of the Soviet Union But this as well as Russia's objection to Washington's plans to develop a national missile defense system is no surprise Today's surprise came when President Putin urged NATO's chief to adopt Russia's plans for a joint project between Europe's NATO members and Russia for their own missile defense 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 inter_segment_gap 760.588000 764.643000 <o,,PRI_TWD> 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 nened_sebek 764.643000 807.427000 <o,male,PRI_TWD> Putin said he hopes that NATO's experts will look at Russia's proposals very soon Then he said his military and civilian experts will be ready to clarify any details and what is especially important Putin said explaining to the European public what exactly Russia is proposing Critics say Moscow is trying to take the issue of national missile defense out of the purely diplomatic and military spheres and present it as a major public issue The idea is to win the hearts and minds of voters in Western Europe and erode NATO's support for the U.  S.  missile defense system NATO chief Robertson has invited President Putin to make his case to the alliance at its Brussels headquarters and promised he would consider the Russian proposals 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 george_robertson 807.427000 825.746000 <o,male,PRI_TWD> It was a very good and useful meeting and I was very pleased to get the Russian proposals on (%hesitation) (%hesitation) missile defense here this morning We will be discussing these matters (%hesitation) at a briefing that the (%hesitation) Russians will be giving (%hesitation) in Brussels at a very early date 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 nened_sebek 825.746000 852.363000 <o,male,PRI_TWD> But so far the Russian proposals are short on specifics It would appear that there is one major difference between the American N.  M.  D.  and the Russian plan N.  M.  D.  would act like a huge shield to stop ballistic missiles from reaching the U.  S.  or any other country which is included in the scheme The Russians appear to be looking at mobile systems which could catch the missiles shortly after their launch Russian defense analyst Dmitri Trenin says the Russian plan boils down to a three stage process 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 dmitri_trenin 852.363000 881.082000 <o,male,PRI_TWD> You first (%hesitation) have a joint strategic assessment of the missile environment B.  you (%hesitation) devise strategies to deal with the threats that you identify not only through military means but primarily political and diplomatic means And (%hesitation) C.  if (%hesitation) if you have to build a missile defense system it will have to be (%hesitation) limited to those (%hesitation) (a-) areas or as (%hesitation) the Russians say strategic directions from which missile attacks will be most likely 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 nened_sebek 881.082000 899.758000 <o,male,PRI_TWD> The Russian version would appear to be smaller less complex and cheaper than a continental shield But just like with the U.  S.  national missile defense plan there is no proof that it would work Either way Moscow has launched a diplomatic offensive and  it  is up to Washington to respond For The World this is Nened Sebek in Moscow 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 lisa_mullins 899.758000 911.145000 <o,female,PRI_TWD> Michael McFall is a senior analyst for Russian affairs with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington Mike McFall explain  what  is happening here  What  is Putin trying to achieve with this diplomatic offensive 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 michael_mcfall 911.145000 944.454000 <o,male,PRI_TWD> Well Putin is going back to the old Soviet days of the early nineteen eighties and trying to split the European allies our European allies from the United States over security issues (%hesitation) This reminds me a lot of what the Soviets tried to do in response to Ronald Reagan's strategic defense initiative so called star wars program and in the early (%hesitation) eighties you had a lot of Russian diplomatic offensives towards the West Europeans to say hey our security interests are one and  they  are different from the United States 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 lisa_mullins 944.454000 951.502000 <o,female,PRI_TWD> Could this be an effective move then given the fact that there is hardly solidarity within NATO toward the United States' missile defense plan 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 michael_mcfall 951.502000 1015.599000 <o,male,PRI_TWD> Absolutely not (%hesitation) I think (%hesitation) just as it failed in the early eighties I think  it  will fail again When push comes to shove Russia is still on the outside of Europe people are still suspicious about Russia's future in terms of becoming a real democracy and a real market economy Therefore no Western European country is going to side up with the Russians and begin to build defenses with the Russians against the United States The relationship between the United States and Germany and England and even France is not just about military capabilities  It  is about intentions I  do  not lose any sleep at night over the fact that England has nuclear weapons I  do  not even know how many soldiers Canada has and frankly I  do  not care  That  is because we believe we know what the intentions of those countries are With Russia  it  is very different With Russia  there  is a lot of uncertainty about those intentions and in many ways the the divide between east and west (%hesitation) that was with us through the Cold War still has not faded 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 lisa_mullins 1015.599000 1029.695000 <o,female,PRI_TWD> What does Russia believe then Does it think Does Vladimir Putin think that the United States will potentially attack therefore it needs its own shield Does it as the U.  S.  does see a threat from rogue nations (%hesitation) such as for instance Iran or North Korea 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 michael_mcfall 1029.695000 1072.826000 <o,male,PRI_TWD> Well  it  is a hard question to answer It seems like Mr Putin wants to have his cake and eat it too On the one hand he goes to Europe and meets and (%hesitation) with Western leaders saying that he wants to become part of Europe and bring Russia into (%hesitation) Europe in a more consolidated way On the other hand he goes off to different places (%hesitation) North Korea (%hesitation) Cuba places that traditionally were Soviet allies It seems to me that he  has  not quite made up his mind whether (h-) he really thinks that Russia can make it as a member of the West or whether Russia will be on the outside of the West and that ambiguity I think is reflected in these very somewhat contradictory foreign policy initiatives coming out of Moscow today 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 lisa_mullins 1072.826000 1077.742000 <o,female,PRI_TWD> Is it serving United States' interests to keep that kind of ambiguity 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 michael_mcfall 1077.742000 1093.382000 <o,male,PRI_TWD> No I  do  not think so I think the less ambiguity the better I think we need to make very clear that national missile defense has very little to do with Russia and has everything to do with rogue states and the sooner we can get to that (%hesitation) agreement the better 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 lisa_mullins 1093.382000 1100.399000 <o,female,PRI_TWD> So in terms of what  we  are hearing now from Russia do you feel as though that this is (%hesitation) back to the bad old days 
20010220_2000_2100_PRI_TWD 1 michael_mcfall 1100.399000 1137.857000 <o,male,PRI_TWD> Well it most certainly  does  not sound good at least in the initial stages and with the change of administration here  there  is a lot of reading of the tea leaves in Moscow going on today In the late Yeltsin years when the President was ill the Russian President when he was very cooperative with the United States we got used to a dynamic where we did all the proposing and the Russians did all the reacting Putin has changed that dynamic He is now going out and putting things on the table putting counter-proposals on the table and putting us on the defensive We now have to respond to these new foreign policy initiatives that  he  is pursuing

E.  O.  of the organizing committee His task To do some serious housecleaning in Salt Lake City Looking back Romney says he  was  not sure that would be enough to save the games

B.  C.'s Lisa Myers on this unexpected development Lisa 
20010221_1830_1900_NBC_NNW 1 lisa_myers 67.232000 172.971000 <o,female,NBC_NNW> Tom the former president issued a statements only minutes ago revealing that his brother-in-law Hugh Rodham had received a contingency fee in connection with two controversial pardons Now Mr Clinton says neither he nor Hillary had any knowledge of such payments at the time and that all monies will be returned One of the pardons went to a Florida man named Glen Braswell convicted seventeen years ago of a scam involving false pitches that diet supplement pills could treat baldness The pardon was rushed through at the last minute so fast that the President's aides claim they had no idea that Braswell is actually the subject of an ongoing federal investigation into what court documents call a massive tax evasion and money laundering scheme Tomorrow's edition of the National Enquirer reports that two days after the pardon was granted on January twenty-second Braswell wired two hundred thousand dollars to the law firm of Hugh Rodham the President's brother-in-law The other act of clemency for which Rodham received an undisclosed fee was for a big time cocaine dealer named Carlos Vignali His sentence was commuted to time served enraging the judge and both prosecutors in the case One calls it a back door deal rotten Tonight the President says he became aware that Rodham had received fees in conjunction with these matters only yesterday Quote neither Hillary nor I had any knowledge of such payments We are deeply disturbed by these reports and have insisted that Hugh return any monies received There also have been reports that the F.  B.  I.  was looking into allegations that the President's brother Roger Clinton had solicited fees to help people get pardons Now sources say that investigation was dropped after it was determined that would not have been illegal Tom

20010221_1830_1900_NBC_NNW 1 tim_russert 183.863000 231.704000 <o,male,NBC_NNW> Absolutely Tom (w-) (w-) back when there was controversy over his involvement in Georgia and and opposing (%hesitation) Mr Shevardnadze who was then the president (%hesitation) And then the President had to apologize for their behavior This one is particularly important (t-) to Democrats down here Tom who  I  have spoken to saying Mr Rodham had to have a contact at the White House Who in fact did he work through at the White House And what did that person know And the second question Tom as you saw in the President Mrs Clinton's statement they said they had no knowledge of payments They did not say they have never spoken to Hugh Rodham about granting these pardons They may have not known about the money but were they in fact lobbied by someone who is a lawyer in Florida who does receive money for his lobbying 
20010221_1830_1900_NBC_NNW 1 tom_brokaw 231.704000 236.147000 <o,male,NBC_NNW> And that Vignali case in California is the one that has a lot of people unsettled Tim 
20010221_1830_1900_NBC_NNW 1 tim_russert 236.147000 264.140000 <o,male,NBC_NNW> Tom the prosecutor in that case in Minneapolis the judge in that case both said they would not recommend a commutation In fact the lawyer who represented Mr Vignali said you have a snowball's chance in hell at getting one How did you get it People kept asking him and he said well the word around the prison was this was a good time to ask the President He was transferring eight hundred pounds of cocaine to be converted into crack This was not a small time drug deal 
20010221_1830_1900_NBC_NNW 1 tom_brokaw 264.140000 273.591000 <o,male,NBC_NNW> Just so  we  are (%hesitation) entirely clear on all of this tonight even if Hugh Rodham did take the money there is probably nothing on the books that makes that illegal in and of itself Tim 
20010221_1830_1900_NBC_NNW 1 tim_russert 273.591000 315.908000 <o,male,NBC_NNW> Unless he went to the President and said I want you to pardon this gentleman  I  am getting paid a good fee A quid pro quo But Tom the fact that Hugh Rodham a practicing lawyer (b-) Hillary Clinton's brother suddenly lands two pardons on the desk one which did not go through any of the Justice Department screening and the other when it went through it was vetoed in effect or attempted by the prosecutor and the judge raise an awful lot of suspicion as to why they were given The President could insist it was done on their merits he had no knowledge of fees given to Mr Rodham but the fact is who brought those applications to his desk and did Hugh Rodham lobby the President personally to in fact grant those pardons 
20010221_1830_1900_NBC_NNW 1 tom_brokaw 315.908000 326.335000 <o,male,NBC_NNW> All right thanks very much N.  B.  C.'s Tim Russert tonight By the way Tim's references to Georgia that was the Republic of Georgia the old Soviet Republic now headed by the former Soviet foreign minister Shevardnadze

Greeneville lose SONAR contact with the Japanese vessel On nuclear subs the fire control technician is supposed to track those contacts But there were sixteen civilian visitors on board the Greeneville And the sub's fire control technician tells the National Transportation Safety Board that they got in the way that he  could  not get to the chart where the contacts are plotted

20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 george_lewis 282.361000 299.489000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> Somewhat embarrassing to the President the quake occurs on a day when his new budget kills a twenty-five million dollar program designed to help communities prepare for disaster With this earthquake centered so far underground University of Washington seismologist Bill Steele says the region got lucky this time 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 bill_steele 299.489000 310.817000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> The shorter period (%hesitation) high acceleration (%hesitation) energy or waves coming from the earthquake are absorbed to some degree (%hesitation) as it moves up to the surface 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 george_lewis 310.817000 322.916000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> Seattle in recent years mindful that this can happen has strengthened building codes to minimize earthquake damage But scientists warn this quake could be just a preview of things to come in future years 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 bill_steele 322.916000 334.129000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> No this is (n-) by no means the big one Off the coast in the Great Cascadia Subduction Zone can produce magnitude nine earthquakes where strong motion will continue for three or four minutes 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 george_lewis 334.129000 361.022000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> Tonight transportation is disrupted The Seattle airport open for only limited flights with broken windows in the control tower Amtrak trains stalled south of Seattle and highway bridges damaged The Space Needle the symbol of Seattle was closed for over two hours today as thirty people trapped inside were rescued And if anyone in Seattle thought it  will  not ever happen here they know better tonight George Lewis N.

20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 brian_williams 361.022000 381.416000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> We are joined tonight by way of explanation by Sue Hough a seismologist with the U.  S.  Geological Survey She is with us from Caltech Pasadena Sue for those viewers who are just now getting home and catching up with this news what did this measure and what is it relative to what they call on the West Coast the big one 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 sue_hough 381.416000 408.776000 <o,female,MNB_NBW> Okay the the magnitude we have now is six point eight it took a little while to converge on that because we really  do  not have (s-) the the same kind of state of the art instruments up in the Pacific Northwest that we do in California (%hesitation) but six point eight is is the good estimate now (%hesitation) (%hesitation) Compared to the potential big one up there (%hesitation) this was moderate (%hesitation) There are some very big faults up there and the big one up there someday (%hesitation) could be quite large As big as magnitude eight point five 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 brian_williams 408.776000 414.793000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> How far down in the earth was the origination point of this one and why does that matter 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 sue_hough 414.793000 429.358000 <o,female,MNB_NBW> It was about thirty miles down The whole fault that ruptured was that far beneath the earth's surface And that just moves it away from (th-) where the people are So by the time the waves get get up to the surface the shaking  is  not nearly as strong (%hesitation) as it would have been if the fault had been more shallow 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 brian_williams 429.358000 438.126000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> Are there different kinds of quakes Is there one that rolls and one that produces (%hesitation) a yawning kind of chasm in the earth and what was this 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 sue_hough 438.126000 452.445000 <o,female,MNB_NBW> (%hesitation) There are very different kinds of quakes but the kind of shaking that you feel depends a lot on where you are whether  you  are on hard rocks or in a basin or (%hesitation) exactly where you are (%hesitation) The the details of the quake will take (%hesitation) a little while for seismologists to unravel 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 brian_williams 452.445000 472.186000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> And (%hesitation) when you look at today's (%hesitation) (%hesitation) injury count (%hesitation)  we  are talking at roughly two dozen This quake just became a fatal quake because a heart attack has been attributed to today The damage yes in the billions There are many buildings in rubble across the state How could it have been worse say just fifty years ago 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 sue_hough 472.186000 484.817000 <o,female,MNB_NBW> Well there has been a lot of of work done to retrofit the schools and (e-) and various aspects of emergency planning And those steps have been very very good We just need to continue that (%hesitation) to bring everything up to (%hesitation) modern building codes 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 brian_williams 484.817000 499.141000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> Now I have to get you on record when you say (%hesitation) the big one (%hesitation) could be a jolt as big as something in the neighborhood of an eight point five (e-) (w-) what would that do to a city the size of Seattle or Portland 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 sue_hough 499.141000 517.809000 <o,female,MNB_NBW> (hm-) You know I think  it  is hard to imagine The shaking would go on for a long time and it would be severe You would see a lot of damage We  do  not want to scare people with doomsday scenarios (%hesitation) because there really is a lot that you can do to prepare for that (%hesitation) But I think it is sort of outside the (c-) (%hesitation) the experience that any of us have at this point 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 brian_williams 517.809000 531.071000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> And how do you straddle that line as a as a public official between you know (%hesitation) voicing a warning that this could be in our future and scaring people to their core especially on a night like this 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 sue_hough 531.071000 546.301000 <o,female,MNB_NBW> Well  that  is the tricky part and the media plays a role in that  it  is presenting balanced information that this eventually will happen (%hesitation) we  do  not know when but there are steps that you can take as individuals and as (%hesitation) collectively the government can take (s-) to really make a difference 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 brian_williams 546.301000 556.366000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> Sue Hough is a seismologist with the U.  S.  Geological Survey  She  has been joining us tonight from Caltech in Pasadena Sue again thank you very much for your contributions tonight

20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 james_lee_whit 581.560000 609.694000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> Well Brian of course we (h-) (th-) FEMA has a regional office right there in Seattle so I know for (h-) the fact that they are working with the state and (%hesitation) and the governor's office and local communities and will be doing the assessments and (%hesitation) (i-) get a good (%hesitation) (c-) assessment of what kind of damage how much the cost is going to be and and I know Joe Allbaugh is on his way there at (%hesitation) the FEMA director and (%hesitation) so (theyl-)  they  will act very quickly and (%hesitation) help meet the need of the people 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 brian_williams 609.694000 621.481000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> Now (e-) same question to you as we just were discussing with the (g-) geologist Where FEMA is concerned how was today's quake different than it would have been say fifty years ago 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 james_lee_whit 621.481000 644.786000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> Well I think you can look at (%hesitation) the Northridge earthquake Do you remember that one in nineteen (%hesitation) nineteen ninety (%hesitation) five or nineteen ninety-four (%hesitation) (i-) It was a six point eight earthquake but it was a shallow earthquake and it (w-) had the motion (%hesitation) instead of (%hesitation) the (dow-) it was down deep (%hesitation) The damage was much greater (%hesitation) You know it was something like thirty billion dollars in

20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 james_lee_whit 646.563000 674.752000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> Yes  that  is right But in Seattle  what  has happened (i-) the they have been a project impact community for three years now And  that  is the program we started you know in ninety-seven that built a public private partnership at the local level And (%hesitation) that disaster prevention program they were going to celebrate their three-year anniversary today And  it  has really made a difference in the schools and in their hospitals and the city halls and all of the communities there in King and Pierce County and Seattle 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 brian_williams 674.752000 687.686000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> When we talk however about the big one as (%hesitation) instead of a six point eight flip the numbers an eight point six perhaps (%hesitation) (ho-)  that  is almost unfathomable especially for those in the business of public health and safety 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 james_lee_whit 687.686000 723.225000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> Well I (th-) I think I think you (c-) you can prepare for any disaster and I think  what  is important is Seattle and that area has (%hesitation) put in some very very good seismic building codes and  they  have enforced those codes  that  is the key The the most important thing is that the life safety codes to protect buildings to keep them from collapsing and  that  is where you save your lives and and injuries And and  that  is what the meeting life safety codes will do and  they  have done a excellent job there in California and all up the coast (%hesitation) or we  would  have seen more deaths in Northridge and even here if they had not

20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 brian_williams 728.424000 751.842000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> A lot of the attention today came when they located the epicenter of this quake at a point between five and ten miles from the capital of the state of Washington in Olympia And a lot of the attention in Olympia was directed squarely at the much revered state (ca-) state house and the dome atop its roof  That  is where N.  B.  C.  News correspondent Shelley Smith joins us from tonight Shelley good evening to you

20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 shelley_smith 753.497000 862.541000 <o,female,MNB_NBW> Good evening Brian Well as you said most of the buildings here including the state capitol that you see behind me have been shut down until engineers can determine that they are safe Although you  cannot see it the dome here actually cracked The building has been yellow tagged you see there is yellow crime scene tape surrounding the building (n-) guards are guarding the building all state employees have been sent home Yellow tag means that people were allowed to go inside (g-) get their belongings but they had to leave They were not allowed to stay Throughout the day engineers have been going over all of the buildings here there are still inspections going on right now (%hesitation) Employees tell us that they  do  not expect to go back to work for several days  It  is going to take that long to determine if these buildings are safe In another legislative building  we  are told the sprinkler system (%hesitation) came on causing major flooding They are in the midst of a legislative session here in Washington so there were plenty of people around but fortunately everyone escaped without injury In another building  we  are told there was severe cracking with (%hesitation) fractures up to one inch wide The building was built in nineteen fifty-five and the inspectors told us that they had expected to have some problems with this building if they did have a quake and in fact they did And even the governor is not sleeping in his home tonight  He  is going to be sleeping with friends because the governor's mansion had to be evacuated Now I spoke with Dr Bruce Warden from the U.  S.  Geological Services office in California today They (w-) actually produce a shake map on every earthquake and  we  are told that sixty-eight hundred people logged on to their website to report shaking And of course the heaviest shaking was in the nine eight five oh one zip code and that is the zip code for Olympia  That  is (th-) that was the epicenter and  that  is where most of the shaking occurred (%hesitation) That is the latest from Olympia Back to you Brian 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 brian_williams 862.541000 882.547000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> Shelley  it  has been said that we will never (%hesitation) (i-) get around this story fully unless our cameras perhaps spend the night with a local family that this story has broken down family by family people whose confidence in terra firma has literally been shaken tonight A lot of people heading outdoors almost instinctively as the only safe place Have you seen much of that since  you  have been on the ground there

20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 waverly_person 1125.996000 1145.119000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> Well the thing about it was we put out (%hesitation) magnitude seven point zero (%hesitation) (r-) right at the onset of the earthquake and we said to everybody it was preliminary After we (%hesitation) looked at our records more closely had more data magnitude six point eight  that  is the (%hesitation) magnitude of the earthquake 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 brian_williams 1145.119000 1159.815000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> Another geophysicist (%hesitation) said today and  I  am quoting it is a very very unlikely that there will be any (f-) felt (%hesitation) in quotes aftershock There is a minimal chance of any more damage (w-) (w-) why is that 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 waverly_person 1159.815000 1192.725000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> (%hesitation) This earthquake was (%hesitation) a little bit deeper than most earthquake This earthquake was about fifty kilometers below the earth's surface or thirty miles And usually when we have an earthquake this deep there are very few aftershocks And usually lessen the death toll from the earthquake as compared to what was in California The earthquake in California in nineteen ninety-four was a magnitude six point seven and very shallow it was (i-) (%hesitation) about (%hesitation) ten to fifteen kilometers below the earth's surface and was much more damage and loss of life 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 brian_williams 1192.725000 1202.488000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> So there is no (%hesitation) absolutely no precursor to be found today that could lead you to say well (%hesitation)  there  is a good chance  we  will have another jolt here shortly 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 waverly_person 1202.488000 1224.195000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> No we had no warning the only thing that we did know we knew that this area could have a major earthquake and close to a major earthquake we had one there in nineteen forty-nine it was a magnitude of about seven point three So everybody asks are were we surprised No we  were  not We knew that it could have that earthquake there And people have to remember that all earthquakes do not occur in California 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 brian_williams 1224.195000 1238.496000 <o,male,MNB_NBW>  That  is true and I want you to I want to get you on record on the kinds of faults in Washington State How do they differ from California how great is the danger of earthquake up in the Pacific Northwest when compared to California 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 waverly_person 1238.496000 1262.611000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> Well we had known for some years that it was (%hesitation) quite dangerous there The Juan de Fuca plate (%hesitation) has been well known and (%hesitation) people and scientists have said that there possibly was a real large earthquake there way back some years ago maybe as much as a nine But closer to the coast that probably could have generated a tsunami This earthquake is much (%hesitation) more inland and no tsunami was generated 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 brian_williams 1262.611000 1281.570000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> During our last hour we had a seismologist tell us that (%hesitation) not only was this not (%hesitation) the big one the catastrophic earthquake (%hesitation) That one may register (%hesitation) perhaps an eight five Perhaps an eight six What kind of an earthquake are we talking about in that event 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 waverly_person 1281.570000 1305.324000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> Well they are saying that looking back at history (tha-) (m-) (%hesitation) they thought they found the indication that that might been an earthquake in that particular area that had been as (%hesitation) high as a nine So  that  is what they are basing it on but no one knows when that might happen or if it may happen but certainly  it  is indication that it has been there and we cannot predict or forecast earthquakes 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 brian_williams 1305.324000 1314.165000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> All right Waverly Person from the National Earthquake Center Thank you sir for tonight's report and for joining us (%hesitation) earlier this afternoon (%hesitation) during such a busy time there 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 brian_williams 1314.165000 1322.438000 <o,male,MNB_NBW>  We  are going to take a break When we come back a report from N.  B.  C.  News correspondent Chip Reid among others in Seattle on the damage so far tonight

B.  C.  News correspondent Chip Reid has arrived in Seattle and has a report for us tonight Chip 
20010228_2100_2200_MNB_NBW 1 chip_reid 1535.535000 1678.940000 <o,male,MNB_NBW> Well Brian there certainly have been quite a few injuries here in Seattle We figure the number at this point reported of people in hospitals is somewhere in the vicinity of sixty-five or seventy At least four seriously injured by falling debris And one person did die of a heart attack but they have not yet determined if that person died as a result of the earthquake But what a lot of people are talking about in Seattle now is not the horror of the earthquake although it certainly did put the fear of God in many of them but how lucky they are (n-) A six point eight earthquake in many parts of this world could have killed hundreds or even thousands Why did they do so Well Well number one about twelve years ago they got a wake-up call here in Seattle The call came all the way from San Francisco Nineteen eighty-nine during that World Series game  you  will remember earthquake in San Francisco very destructive They saw that and they started retrofitting fitting their buildings they changed their building codes They really have been working very hard here in Seattle for (b-) bout (%hesitation) about a dozen years to get this place ready for a big earthquake (%hesitation) And they feel that they have done very well and they feel that that saved many lives Another reason as your experts have been saying this one was fortunate for Seattle about thirty miles underground And that made a huge difference because by the time the vibrations got to the surface they  were  not as severe as they had been down below And the third reason  they  are breathing a sigh of relief is that this was not the big one Seattle is an area that sits near what is known as the Subduction Zone where one fault goes underneath another one And they are capable here of having an earthquake in the range of a nine magnitude That would be absolutely devastating Six point eight is bad but certainly nothing like a nine (%hesitation) And you can bet that there will be some work in the coming years to prepare for something even bigger than this By the way Brian the Space Needle (%hesitation) I think you can see it over my right shoulder here in the studio but it is right across the street from us here and for about two hours today there were about thirty tourists trapped up there as it swayed in this earthquake for at least a short period of time But that Space Needle was built to withstand an earthquake of nine point one (%hesitation) Also to (i-) (%hesitation) withstand winds well over one hundred miles per hour (%hesitation) So they say (%hesitation) officials say that they were very safe up there the entire time and in fact (%hesitation) after about two hours they opened it up again and let people very brave people go back up there and eat dinner
